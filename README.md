You know how sites use your code without credit? Well I deploy [interledger](https://interledger.org/overview.html) to audit functionality for [fair dealings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing). In fact, I'd like to give out bounties (or even fellowships) to reward open-source development (合作社).

## Why?
1. 1992 - After some headbutting, China agreed to drop its indigenous [Software Protection regulations](http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/rftpocs542/) in favor of creative **literary works** protected under copyright (with antecedents in state controlling printing press). This is an imperfect fit as negotiating discrete derivative works doesn't reflect modern software a) _continuous_ build, _fungible_ code languages, and _collective_ ownership. This also means all the other baggage from [idea-expression dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%E2%80%93expression_distinction) get attached and we haven't even started on moral rights or databases and API standards.
1. 2001 - The infamous [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) strategy to marginalise collective (de jure) standards via incompatible extensions within a dominant (de facto) market position. History shows how difficult it is for [individual contributors](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2019/apr/02/vmware-no-appeal/) to **challenge vendors on non-compliance**. 
1. 2015 - [Selfie Monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute#cite_note-5) where a photographer suffered financially and personally when the scene staging and [aesthetic selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) (IMHO sufficient elements for creativity) was not considered by distributors as **proof of authorship**, instead favoring the proximate cause of image capture (monkey as creator). Thus whilst actual legal protection resides in a relatively small visible code, real infostructure (regression testing, education, community onboarding, etc) with all its associated costs (which needs to be recovered) is needed for robust production. 

So the question is how to make a living wage [1](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2769875) without resorting to Li'Sister practices or adversarial court action? Putting aside clean-room reimplementation of proprietary source for now, what can be done to increase the global pool of social capital (open source code) in a more sustainable manner? 

## How to ...
* [TBD] sample sandbox code as proof of concept.

## Free (but with strings)
I intended to use the [TBC open security license???] license so intend to dual license later.
